# Tuesday assignment

> We'll be starting with our final assignment today! The assignment consists mostly of research, but also some concepting and brainstorming. At the end of the day, you have a better idea of what you'll be creating at the end of the Tech Track, as well as a or multiple sources of data. Who knows, maybe you'll construct your own dataset!

## Assignment

 - Conduct research, on or offline, into a subject you find interesting. This can be a tweet you recently saw, or an article you read online. It can be something _entirely of your choice_. Remember, we'll be grading the visualization and you'll be working on it for 6 full weeks. Best to pick something you find interesting!

 - Start by looking into relevant datasets. Perhaps the [CBS](https://www.cbs.nl/) has something interesting online? Or you can check existing datasets from the [Gemeente Amsterdam](https://data.amsterdam.nl/). GitHub also hosts a plethora of datasets and you're of course free to create your own dataset if you want to.

 - Explore existing datasets and note your findings. What are "beautiful" datasets, did some of the interaction surprise you? What did you learn from it, how did it affect you? Is there something from this dataset that you wish to incorporate yourself?

In addition, read the following article by [Curran Kelleher](https://twitter.com/currankelleher):

## Deliverables

> The following items should be included in your documentation

 - Your initial research into (possible) visualization subjects.
 - Your findings in terms of (possible) datasets.
 - A listing of interesting visualizations and why these caught your eye.
